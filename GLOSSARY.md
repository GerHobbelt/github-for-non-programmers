# Version Control
In programming, it's a way to track changes made to code over time. This means that mistakes can be easily reverted. You also don't have to worry if you're using the most recent copy of something--the version control system makes it easy to see if something has changed.

# Git
One of the most popular programs for implementing version control.

# Repository
Also just "repo" for short, it's the folder that contains all of the files you want git to track for you.

# Commit
A specific snapshot of your work. You manually choose when to create a commit, and you need to give it a descriptive name.

# GitHub
A website that lets you keep a copy of your repository online. It also allows you to collaborate with others on the same repository, keeping track of who changes what and avoiding conflicts.
