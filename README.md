# GitHub for Non-Programmers

As a programmer, using `git` and GitHub makes work much easier. But most of my colleagues are not programmers. I believe they could benefit from GitHub as well, but they don't already know how to use it and aren't inclined to become "hackers". That's why I'm writing this guide: I want to demonstrate a simple workflow with GitHub that anyone--not merely coders--can follow and benefit from.

## Who is This Guide For?

This guide isn't meant to turn someone into a `git` master. It should show non-programmers a simple way to add `git` and GitHub to their work process with a minimum of jargon. This guide will contain no code, and it will only show how to use the GitHub desktop app for simplicity's sake.

The audience I'm writing this for probably doesn't write code, and probably never wants to write code. They are happy with the subpar version control they have (e.g., `file.docx`, `file final.docx`, `file FINAL.docx`, etc.), not because it's good, but because they don't know any other way to do it. They won't adopt GitHub unless they are shown clearly and simply what it is, what pain points it solves, and how they can start using it without having to learn too much.

Don't think I'm judging the audience--this is all normal human behavior. The audience knows lots of things that I don't know and, frankly, don't want to know. But I do know GitHub, and I think their lives would be better if they did too. So I'm going to try to convince them as gently as possible.
