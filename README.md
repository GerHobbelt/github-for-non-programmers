# GitHub for Non-Programmers

As a programmer, using `git` and GitHub makes work much easier. But most of my colleagues are economists, not programmers. I believe they could benefit from GitHub as well, but they don't already know how to use it and aren't inclined to become "hackers". That's why I'm writing this guide: I want to demonstrate a simple workflow with GitHub that anyone--not merely coders--can follow and benefit from.

This guide isn't meant to turn someone into a `git` master. It should show non-programmers a simple way to add `git` and GitHub to their work process with a minimum of jargon. This guide will contain no code, and it will only show how to use the GitHub desktop app for simplicity's sake.
